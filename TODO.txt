 CRITICAL
 - LiveAPI init errors on load set
 - Push buttons don't work
 - arm on push buttons (default: disabled)
   - but always arm on record even on Push
 - crackles at start of transport
 - 'clear all' on note 32 flashes opaque on grid before clear
 - replace hard-coded 8 track_device count assigment in init
 - track offset
 - implement session view control
 - tempo click/flash
 - instrument groups for arming.
   - Only change arm for instruments in group. I.e. Violin group, vocal group, bass group, midi group (for push grid). How to add tracks to a group via max ui? Maybe just list tracks and add number box to map to group. Sick
 - Finish Max UI

 WISH LIST
 - options:
   - Sustain pedal mode
 - allow playing piano while looping with bass
 - output visual pulse on loop restart?
 - Push UI doesn't update when looper State changes on it's own.
 - destruct doPoll timer on reload (forum)

 FORUMS
 - call js function on [freebang]? Max freezes up...
